In general, the fewer (and simpler) tools an agent is given, the more likely it is to be reliable.By remembering ai <-> tool interactions, that can hog the context window occasionally. That's why we've included a flag to disable that type of memory, and more generally have made memory pretty plug-and-play.This new agent is in both Python and JS - you can use these guides to get started:JSPythonLLM applications are rapidly evolving. Our NotionQA demo was one of the first we did - and although it was only ~9 months ago the best practices have shifted dramatically since then.

              "  Document(page_content=\"Agents may be the “killer” LLM app, but building and evaluating agents is hard. Function calling is a key skill for effective tool use, but there aren’t many good benchmarks for measuring function calling performance. Today, we are excited to release four new test environments for benchmarking LLMs’ ability to effectively use tools to accomplish tasks. We hope this makes it easier for everyone to test different LLM and prompting strategies to show what enables the best agentic behavior.Example successful tool use for the Relational Data taskWe designed these tasks to test capabilities we consider to be prerequisites for common agentic workflows, such as planning / task decomposition, function calling, and the ability to override pre-trained biases when needed. If an LLM is unable to solve these types of tasks (without explicit fine-tuning), it will likely struggle to perform and generalize reliably for other workflows where “reasoning” is required. Below are some key take-ways for those eager to see our findings:Overall performance across all tasks (weighted average). Error bars computed using standard error.💡Key Findings - All of the models can fail over longer trajectories, even for simple tasks.- GPT-4 got the highest score on the Relational Data task, which most closely approximates common usage.- GPT-4 seems to be worse than GPT-3.5 on the Multiverse Math task; it's possible its pretrained bias hinders its performance in an example of inverse scaling.- Claude-2.1 performs within the error bounds of GPT-4 for 3 of 4 tasks, though seems to lag GPT-4 on the relational data task.- Despite outputting well-formatted tool invocations, AnyScale’s fine-tuned variant of Mistral 7b struggles to reliably compose more than 2 calls. Future open-source function calling efforts should focus on function composition in addition to single-call correctness.- In addition to model quality, service reliability is important. We ran into frequent random 5xx errors from the most popular model providers.🦜So what?- Superhuman model knowledge doesn't help if your task or knowledge differs significantly from its pre-training. Validate the LLM you choose on the behavior patterns you need it to excel on before deploying.- Planning is still hard for LLMs - the likelihood of failure increases with the number of required steps,\", metadata={'source': 'https://blog.langchain.dev/benchmarking-agent-tool-use/', 'loc': 'https://blog.langchain.dev/benchmarking-agent-tool-use/', 'lastmod': '2023-12-20T17:54:03.000Z'}),\n",

Each agent could even be powered by a separate fine-tuned LLM!Helpful conceptual model to develop. You can evaluate and improve each agent individually without breaking the larger application. Multi-agent designs allow you to divide complicated problems into tractable units of work that can be targeted by specialized agents and LLM programs.Multi-agent examplesWe\\'ve added three separate example of multi-agent workflows to the langgraph repo. Each of these has slightly different answers for the above two questions, which we will go over when we highlight the examples. It\\'s important to note that these three examples are only a few of the possible examples we could highlight - there are almost assuredly other examples out there and we look forward to seeing what the community comes up with!Multi Agent CollaborationCode links:PythonJSIn this example, the different agents collaborate on a shared scratchpad of messages. This means that all the work either of them do is visible to the other. This has the benefit that other agents can see all the individual steps done. This has the downside that sometimes is it overly verbose and unnecessary to pass ALL this information along, and sometimes only the final answer from an agent is needed. We call this collaboration because of the shared nature the scratchpad.What are the multiple independent agents?In this case, the independent agents are actually just a single LLM call. Specifically, they are a specific prompt template (to format inputs in a specific way with a specific system message) plus an LLM call.How are those agents connected?Here is a visualization of how these agents are connected:The main thing controlling the state transitions is the router, but it is a rule-based router and so is rather quite simple. Basically, after each LLM call it looks at the output. If a tool is invoked, then it calls that tool. If no tool is called and the LLM responds \"FINAL ANSWER\" then it returns to the user. Otherwise (if no tool is called and the LLM does not respond \"FINAL ANSWER\") then it goes to the other LLM.Agent SupervisorExamples:PythonJSIn this example, multiple agents are connected, but compared to above they do NOT share a shared scratchpad. Rather, they have their own independent scratchpads, and then their final responses are appended', metadata={'source': 'https://blog.langchain.dev/langgraph-multi-agent-workflows/', 'loc': 'https://blog.langchain.dev/langgraph-multi-agent-workflows/', 'lastmod': '2024-01-23T17:32:37.000Z'}),\n",

Let’s dive into this prompt a bit:The first thing to note is the framing: you are a character playing in front of a live audience. We found that directly telling the agent this generated a lot more chatter, which helped make our simulation more interesting to observers. It inspired the agents to talk to themselves when they were doing a task (for example, saying things like “Wow that’s interesting” when searching on google).The next thing to note is the prioritization of dialog. This is something we did in the react function as well. Even if the current plan has nothing to do with dialog, we instruct the agent here to finish their pending conversations first, reminding them they need not respond all the time.The rest of the prompt is pretty straight forward, and heavily inspired by the default langchain agent prompt. We include the agent’s bio, their location context, relevant memories, conversation history, and tools available. Quick note: every agent has a public bio and a private bio. The public bio is a description that all the other agents have access to, such as their role, their appearence, and their name. A private bio includes details that only the agent themselves know, such as their insecurities and desires.We referred to this plan + tool usage action as a single step. The execute function of the PlanExecutor class runs the agent for one step each time it’s called. After a step is run, a string representation of the step is added to a list of historical steps contained within the current plan (we borrow from Langchain’s terminology here when we call that a scratchpad).We save the scratchpad at the end of the function so that the agent can pick up where it left off in the next run of the agent loop.Agent.reflectAs the final step of every agent loop, we check if it’s time to reflect. This function is triggered every time the total importance score across all of an agent’s memories reaches a multiple of 100. This way, if the agent is experiencing something extremely exciting and memorable, it will reflect more often, and vice versa.This reflection logic was borrowed directly from the brilliant authors of the “Generative Agents”', metadata={'source': 'https://blog.langchain.dev/gpteam-a-multi-agent-simulation/', 'loc': 'https://blog.langchain.dev/gpteam-a-multi-agent-simulation/', 'lastmod': '2023-06-24T21:34:28.000Z'})]}"
