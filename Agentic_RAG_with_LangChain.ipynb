The beauty of RAG lies in its ability to enable a language model to draw upon and leverage your own data to generate responses. While base models are traditionally trained on specific, point-in-time data, ensuring their effectiveness in performing tasks and adapting to the desired domain, they can struggle when faced with newer or current data. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an architecture that augments the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT by adding an information retrieval system that provides grounding data. Adding an information retrieval system gives you control over grounding data used by an LLM when it formulates a response. RAG stands for R etrieval- A ugmented G eneration. RAG enables large language models (LLM) to access and utilize up-to-date information. Hence, it improves the quality of relevance of the response from LLM.

Compared with conventional\\ngeneration models, retrieval-augmented text generation has remarkable\\nadvantages and particularly has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many\\nNLP tasks. This paper aims to conduct a survey about retrieval-augmented text\\ngeneration. It firstly highlights the generic paradigm of retrieval-augmented\\ngeneration, and then it reviews notable approaches according to different tasks\\nincluding dialogue response generation, machine translation, and other\\ngeneration tasks. Finally, it points out some important directions on top of\\nrecent methods to facilitate future research.\\n\\nPublished: 2023-12-09\\nTitle: Context Tuning for Retrieval Augmented Generation\\nAuthors: Raviteja Anantha, Tharun Bethi, Danil Vodianik, Srinivas Chappidi\\nSummary: Large language models (LLMs) have the remarkable ability to solve new tasks\\nwith just a few examples, but they need access to the right tools. Retrieval\\nAugmented Generation (RAG) addresses this problem by retrieving a list of\\nrelevant tools for a given task. However, RAG's tool retrieval step requires\\nall the required information to be explicitly present in the query. This is a\\nlimitation, as semantic search, the widely adopted tool retrieval method, can\\nfail when the query is incomplete or lacks context. To address this limitation,\\nwe propose Context Tuning for RAG, which employs a smart context retrieval\\nsystem to fetch relevant information that improves both tool retrieval and plan\\ngeneration. Our lightweight context retrieval model uses numerical,\\ncategorical, and habitual usage signals to retrieve and rank context items. Our\\nempirical results demonstrate that context tuning significantly enhances\\nsemantic search, achieving a 3.5-fold and 1.5-fold improvement in Recall@K for\\ncontext retrieval and tool retrieval tasks respectively, and resulting in an\\n11.6% increase in LLM-based planner accuracy. Additionally, we show that our\\nproposed lightweight model using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) with LambdaMART\\noutperforms GPT-4 based retrieval. Moreover, we observe context augmentation at\\nplan generation, even after tool retrieval, reduces hallucination.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-02-16\\nTitle: Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation\\nAuthors: Shi-Qi Yan, Jia-Chen Gu, Yun Zhu, Zhen-Hua Ling\\nSummary: Large language models (LLMs) inevitably exhibit hallucinations since the\\naccuracy of generated texts cannot be secured solely by the parametric\\nknowledge they encapsulate. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a\\npracticable complement to LLMs, it relies heavily on the relevance of retrieved\\ndocuments, raising concerns about how the model behaves if retrieval goes\\nwrong. To this end, we propose the Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation\\n(CRAG) to improve the robustness of generation. Specifically, a lightweight\\nretrieval evaluator is designed to assess the overall quality of retrieved\\ndocuments for a query, returning a confidence degree based on which different\\nknowledge retrieval actions can be triggered. Since retrieval from static and\\nlimited corpora can only return sub-optimal documents, large-scale web searches\\nare utilized as an extension for augmenting the retrieval results. Besides, a\\ndecompose-then-recompose algorithm is designed for retrieved documents to\\nselectively focus on key information and filter out irrelevant information in\\nthem. CRAG is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly coupled with various\\nRAG-based approaches. Experiments on four datasets covering short- and\\nlong-form generation tasks show that CRAG can significantly improve the\\nperformance of RAG-based approaches.\", name='arxiv'),\n",
